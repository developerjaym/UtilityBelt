# Intro
I doubt anyone will ever contribute, so I won't spend much time on this file. 
# What to contribute
I would appreciate bug fixes, version upgrades, i18n, a11y, styling and design improvements (I am bad at UI/UX), and high-quality general-purpose built-in functions (the functions that people see before they make their own).
# What not to contribute
Anything that takes up a lot of space, anything that most people wouldn't find useful, anything dangerous, anything buggy, anything that slows down the app significantly.
